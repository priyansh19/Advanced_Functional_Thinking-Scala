# Scala - Scalable Language.

Scala is most frequently used programming language for data processing and machine learning tasks because of few reasons:
1. Functional paradigm and scripting approach
2. It is a very Consise, Interactive(REPL) and Expressive, Scalable, High-level, Statically typed, Compatible language.
3. It is **pure** fuctional programming language.
4. Null pointer do not affect the programming in scala.

Features:

1. Case sensitive language
2. Purely Object Oriented Language
3. Suports Functional programming paradigm
4. 

In scala there is a difference between Methods and Functions

1. Methods:
 ```
	A. it cannot be called without creating an objects.
	B. are called by reference variables.
	C. the arguments are implicitly passed while calling its object.
	D. applicable in the case of only object oriented programming. 
```
2. Functions:
```
	A. it can be called without creating objects.
	B. are called without creating a refernece
	C. the arguments are explicitly passed.
	D. applicable on both types of all types of programming.
